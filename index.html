		    	    <p>The massacres overwhelmingly targeted Maya peoples. Most included not just the mass killing of defenseless people, but sadistic acts including torture, rape, and the burning of entire villages. These traumatic events left lasting devastatation in Indigenous communities, including the home regions of Claudia, Jakelin, Felipe, Juan, Wilmer, and Carlos.</p>

		    	    	<br>
		    	    The Ch'orti' region suffered some of the first massacres recorded by the CEH in the conflict period (1960–1996). During the mid 1960's, the Guatemalan army and CIA-trained death squads killed thousands of peasants in the eastern part of the country.</p>

               		<p> Though the guerrilla combatants in the east numbered less than 500, the military counter-insurgency claimed an estimated 6,000-8,000 lives, as the army executed suspected leftists with impunity. While the massacres recorded by the CEH represent only a fraction of the death toll, the testimony of survivors reveals the brutality of the "counter-terror" campaign.

                    <br>
	                Across Guatemala, state violence was deployed to dispossess Indigenous lands and destroy grassroots resistance to capitalist projects. In Q'eqchi' territory, peaceful protests of mining and massive inequality in land ownership were met with violence.</p>

                    <p>On May 29, 1978, the Army opened fire on a crowd of Q'eqchi' peasants gathered in Panzós to protest land evictions and intimidation by the local planter elite. At least 50 were killed, and over the next four years the army executed more than 300 Q'eqchi' community organizers and ancestral authorities involved with the land dispute in the Polochic Valley.</p>

                    <br>
                    The violence escalated after Panzós. According to the CEH, the early 1980's were the years <span class="ceh">"most stained with death, destruction and pain in the contemporary history of the country."</span>. Genocide was unleashed in several Indigenous territories, including that of the Maya-Achi, where the Army slaughtered and displaced villagers who resisted the construction of a hydroelectic dam financed by the World Bank.

                    <p>The villagers of Río Negro refused to leave their lands, protesting the planned damming of the Chixoy river, which would flood more than 50 square kilometers, displace thousands of people from their ancestral lands, and destroy at least 50 ceremonial and archeological sites. The villagers were branded guerrillas, mercilessly killed, and driven into the mountains where many perished from starvation.</p>
