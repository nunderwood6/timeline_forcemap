              To visualize how this indiscriminate violence left lasting devastation in Indigenous communities, including the home regions of Claudia, Jakelin, Felipe, Juan, Wilmer, and Carlos, I transcribed data on the 600+ massacres recorded in the CEH report and mapped them.</p>

		    	    The Ch'orti' region suffered some of the first massacres recorded by the CEH in the conflict period (1960–1996). During the mid 1960's, the Guatemalan army and CIA-trained death squads killed thousands of peasants in the eastern part of the country.</p>

	                Across Guatemala, state violence was used to crush any resistance to the domination of the elites and foreign corporations. In Q'eqchi' territory, peaceful resistance to land dispossession and mining projects was treated as Communist insurgency and met with indiscriminate violence.</p>

                    The violence continued to escalate after Panzós. According to the CEH, the early 1980's were the years <span class="ceh">"most stained with death, destruction and pain in the contemporary history of the country."</span>. Genocide was unleashed in several Indigenous territories, including that of the Maya-Achi, where the Army savagely repressed villagers who resisted the construction of a hydroelectic dam financed by the World Bank.
