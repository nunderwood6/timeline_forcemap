		    	    <p>The massacres overwhelmingly targeted Maya peoples. Most included not just the mass killing of defenseless people, but sadistic acts including torture, sexual violence, and the burning of entire villages. These traumatic events left lasting devastatation in Indigenous communities, including the home regions of Claudia, Jakelin, Felipe, Juan, Wilmer, and Carlos.</p>

		    	    The Ch'orti' region suffered some of the first massacres recorded by the CEH in the conflict period (1960–1996). During the mid 1960's, the Guatemalan army and CIA-trained death squads killed thousands of peasants in the eastern part of the country.</p>

               		<p> Though the guerrilla combatants in the east numbered less than 500, the military counter-insurgency claimed an estimated 6,000-8,000 lives, as the army executed suspected leftists with impunity. While the massacres recorded by the CEH represent only a fraction of the death toll, the testimony of survivors reveals the devastation wrought by the "counter-terror" campaign.

Interrogations are brutal, torture is used and bodies are mutilated…We have been so obsessed with the fear of insurgency that we have rationalized away our qualms and uneasiness. This is not only because we have concluded we cannot do anything about it, for we never really tried. Rather we suspected that maybe it is a good tactic, and that as long as Communists are being killed it is alright...we will stand before history unable to answer the accusations that we encouraged the Guatemalan Army to do these things.”</p>

	                Across Guatemala, state violence was used to crush any resistance to the domination of the elites and foreign corporations. In Q'eqchi' territory, peaceful resistance to land dispossession and mining projects was treated as Communist insurgency and met with indiscriminate violence.</p>

                    <p>On May 29, 1978, the Army opened fire on a crowd of Q'eqchi' peasants gathered in Panzós to protest land evictions and intimidation by the local planter elite. At least 50 were massacred, and over the next four years the army executed more than 300 ancestral authorities and community organizers involved with the land dispute.</p>

                    The violence continued to escalate after Panzós. According to the CEH, the early 1980's were the years <span class="ceh">"most stained with death, destruction and pain in the contemporary history of the country."</span>. Genocide was unleashed in several Indigenous territories, including that of the Maya-Achi, where the Army savagely repressed villagers who resisted the construction of a hydroelectic dam financed by the World Bank.

The villagers were branded guerrillas, ruthlessly massacred, and driven into the mountains where many perished from starvation. Months after the massacres, the reservoir was filled.</p>

                    <p>The U.S. continued to support the government's criminal counter-insurgency campaign with money, weapons, and diplomatic support. On December 4, 1982, U.S. President Ronald Reagan met with Guatemalan dictator Efraín Ríos Montt, who would later be convicted of genocide, and stated, “I know that President Rios Montt is a man of great personal integrity and commitment...I know he wants to improve the quality of life for all Guatemalans and to promote social justice.” (Reagan Library 1982).</p>

Further, the connections between massacres and extractive projects documented by the CEH indicate government terror went far beyond fighting communism and guerrillas—its real aim was to brutally repress social movements and annihilate all who resisted to the domination of the oligarchy.</p>
